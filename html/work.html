    <p>&emsp;&emsp;• <u>PCI data</u>: This dashboard reflects information for all the level 4 and 5 vulnerabilities for PCI data. The dashboard has data filters for server owner, severity, and date and time modifiers. All data can be represented in &emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chart and table format.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>• Creating Python Scripts:</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;• <u>Track PCI Progress:</u></p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• The script creates a PowerPoint presentation with vulnerability results in a bar and pie chart to show what is new, remediated, and existing.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• Python script that takes in two excel sheets and finds the rows that do not match and produces two output files with the rows that do not match.</p>
